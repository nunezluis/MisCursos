## Reported experiences closely aligned with a FabLab + DIY mechanics lab

1. **“Scientific FabLab” embedded in a research institute (ICTP, Trieste)**

   * Describes how a FabLab inside an academic institution supports **physics education via prototyping**, low-cost instrumentation, and student-led building/iteration culture. ([arXiv][1])

2. **University physics “prototyping” course built around making and instrumentation (UCSB Physics 150)**

   * A course explicitly organized around **fabrication + electronics + measurement**, where students prototype experimental devices (a very direct analog to your advanced experimental-physics framing).

3. **Project-based physics laboratories using low-cost open-source hardware (Arduino-centered)**

   * A widely cited model: students define the measurement problem, design apparatus, build with low-cost parts, and validate results—explicitly reported as a “project-based physics lab.” ([pubs.aip.org][2])

4. **Reform of an introductory mechanics lab using Arduino + smartphone, evaluated with E-CLASS**

   * Focused specifically on **mechanics labs** and reports measured outcomes (questionnaires + E-CLASS), including teamwork/equity signals—useful if you want evidence-based justification. ([arXiv][3])

5. **Arduino + smartphone integration for physics practicals (course design + scalability)**

   * Discusses how Arduino and smartphones can be integrated into practical work (logistics, learning design), i.e., “how to run it” not only “cool demos.” ([uvadoc.uva.es][4])

6. **Smartphone-as-sensor frameworks (phyphox) used for quantitative mechanics experiments**

   * phyphox is one of the most cited smartphone lab frameworks; the paper details the design rationale and how the app supports reproducible experiments with built-in sensors (accel/gyro/magnetometer/mic, etc.). ([arXiv][5])
   * A complementary engineering-education example: designing **at-home experiments** with phones + basic test gear (useful if you ever want “lab-in-a-box” variants). ([peer.asee.org][6])

7. **Digital fabrication of *classic* mechanics apparatus (laser cut + 3D printed linear air track)**

   * A direct “FabLab → mechanics lab equipment” exemplar: building an air track using **laser cutting + 3D printing**, aimed at kinematics/dynamics labs and explicitly framed as a *maker* approach. ([ResearchGate][7])

8. **Microcontroller + 3D-printed parts for kinematics on an air track (micro:bit-based)**

   * Demonstrates “instrument the classic apparatus” with **optical sensors + microcontroller + 3D-printed elements**, matching the DIY-instrumentation spirit. ([publicatio.bibl.u-szeged.hu][8])

9. **Video analysis as a low-cost quantitative mechanics lab (Tracker / Open Source Physics)**

   * Tracker is a canonical pathway for FabLab-style mechanics: students fabricate/rig a setup, record motion, and extract kinematics/forces quantitatively—widely adopted and well documented. ([sg.iwant2study.org][9])

10. **3D printing projects inserted into introductory physics labs (AAPT / The Physics Teacher)**

* A concrete pathway to “FabLab modules” inside a first lab sequence: students design/print components to modify or extend standard experiments. ([pubs.aip.org][10])

11. **Wireless open-source sensor platforms for kinematics/dynamics labs**

* Reported as a platform enabling instructors/students to build kinematics/dynamics experiments with sensors + wireless data acquisition, explicitly targeting early physics labs. ([uvadoc.uva.es][11])

12. **Curated “ready-to-run” DIY experiment ecosystem (Arduino Physics Lab)**

* Not a paper, but a structured web resource with experiments and teacher-facing materials; useful as a baseline that your students can “hack” and extend. ([Physics Lab Arduino][12])
